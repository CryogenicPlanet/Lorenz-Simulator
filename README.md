## Lorenz Simulator 

This project is an open source project where I streamed the entire development process on twitch, the project aims to create a web based simulator for the Lorzen System, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system.

The project aims to make an interactive experience where the user can choose the start point and see the system being solved live

This project is based on worked I did in a [Scienctific Computing class (PSCB57)](https://github.com/CryogenicPlanet/Introduction-to-Scientific-Computing) which I took in my first year, this class thought me the methods required to solve systems systems used techniques like RK4. I also wrote a blog post clearly explaining my method https://medium.com/etwas/higher-order-numeric-differential-equations-python-bc23dd148a0b
